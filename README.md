### Hi there from Ayian Shariff ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate and diligent Statistics and Computer Science sophomore looking for internships in data science and software engineering. Dean's list recipient. Two years experience in software design and development using Python for Data Science, Java, and C++ via self-initiated passion projects and school projects. Committed team player with strong communication skills.

## Highlighted Projects

#### [Predicting Parkinson's Disease](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Parkinson's%20Disease%20Project%20README.pdf)

Worked with a dataset that contained various predictive factors of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. Trained XGBClassifier on the dataset to identify whether or not a particular individual has Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Found that XGBoost was the most accurate model in predicting whether a person has Parkinsonâ€™s disease or not at 94.87%.


#### [Detecting Fake News](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Fake%20News%20Project%20README.pdf)

Implemented a Passive Aggressive Classifier model to determine whether a piece of news was fake or real. Trained the model with a news dataset containing a label that depicted whether the piece of news was fake or real. The model testing resulted in 93% accuracy of predictions.


#### [Surviving the Titanic](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Titanic%20README.pdf)

Analyzed factors associated with surviving the Titanic crash. Used machine learning in order to train and test various models after splitting the dataset. Gender was the most important factor in surviving the crash and random forest was the most accurate model in predicting whether a person would survive the titanic crash or not at 75.58%.

#### [Identifying Legendary Pokemon](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Pokemon%20Project%20README.pdf)

Predicted whether or not a particular Pokemon was legendary based on features from the Pokemon dataset. Cleaned and normalized the dataset before training various models in order to compare their accuracy in predicting a Pokemonâ€™s legendary status. Found that the random forest model had the highest accuracy in predicting whether a particular Pokemon was legendary or not at 96.05% and speed attack is the most important predictor of a Pokemonâ€™s legendary status.
