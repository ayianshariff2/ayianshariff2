### Hi there from Ayian Shariff!

I am a passionate and diligent Statistics and Computer Science student looking for full time jobs in data science and software engineering. Dean's list recipient. Three years experience in software design and development using Python for Data Science, Java, and C++ via self-initiated passion projects and school projects. Committed team player with strong communication skills.

## Highlighted Projects

#### [Airline Customer Satisfaction](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Airline%20Customer%20Satisfaction%20Report.pdf)
Applied the logistic regression, the decision tree, and the random forest model to identify key factors driving airline customer satisfaction from a dataset of over 120,000 passengers. Amongst the three models, the random forest model achieved the highest accuracy at 95.67% and the highest testing AUC at 0.9899. The online boarding experience, in-flight wifi service, and travel class were the most important predictors of customer satisfaction with an airline.

#### [Predicting Parkinson's Disease](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Parkinson's%20Disease%20Project%20README.pdf)

Worked with a dataset that contained various predictive factors of Parkinson’s Disease. Trained XGBClassifier on the dataset to identify whether or not a particular individual has Parkinson’s disease. Found that XGBoost was the most accurate model in predicting whether a person has Parkinson’s disease or not at 94.87%.

#### [Detecting Fake News](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Fake%20News%20Project%20README.pdf)

Implemented a Passive Aggressive Classifier model to determine whether a piece of news was fake or real. Trained the model with a news dataset containing a label that depicted whether the piece of news was fake or real. The model testing resulted in 93% accuracy of predictions.

#### [Surviving the Titanic](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Titanic%20README.pdf)

Analyzed factors associated with surviving the Titanic crash. Used machine learning in order to train and test various models after splitting the dataset. Gender was the most important factor in surviving the crash and random forest was the most accurate model in predicting whether a person would survive the titanic crash or not at 75.58%.

#### [Income Level Predictor](https://github.com/ayianshariff2/projects/blob/main/Salary%20Predictor%20README.pdf)

Analyzed the global census data to identify key factors that influence individual income levels. Implemented various models including XGBoost and random forest classifier to predict the income levels based on the identified factors. Based on testing with 5000+ data points, the random forest classifier is the most accurate predictor of a person’s income level at 85.5%.
